# What is Javascript?
A programming lanugage.

# Where does Javascript run?
Javascript used to run in browsers only. Each browser has its engine run Javascript. Firefox uses spidermonkey, Chrome uses V8. However, a while back, someone got the idea to be able to run Javascript in a C++ program. This is called Node.js. With this, we can run javascript code outside of a browser (i.e. Javascript is either run inside a browser or in Node).

You don't necessarily need Node since you can execute code directly in your browser, but it will allow you to use 3rd-party libraries if you do.
